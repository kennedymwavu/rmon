Description: The 'R' equivalent of 'nodemon'. Watches specified
    directories for file changes and reruns a designated 'R' script when
    changes are detected. It's designed to automate the process of
    reloading your 'R' applications during development, similar to
    'nodemon' for 'Node.js'.
